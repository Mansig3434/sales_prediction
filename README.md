# Sales Prediction Using Python 🧠
This project is a machine learning solution that predicts product sales based on advertising spend across multiple channels — TV, Radio, and Newspaper. It uses a supervised regression approach to estimate how much impact each medium has on overall sales performance.

# 🔍 Project Objective
1. To build a regression model that:

2. Learns patterns from historical advertising data.

3. Predicts future sales based on ad budget allocation.

4. Helps businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python 3

2. Pandas, NumPy for data processing

3. Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
