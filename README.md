Sales Prediction Using Python 🧠
This project is a machine learning solution that predicts product sales based on advertising spend across multiple channels — TV, Radio, and Newspaper. It uses a supervised regression approach to estimate how much impact each medium has on overall sales performance.

🔍 Project Objective
# To build a regression model that:

# Learns patterns from historical advertising data.

# Predicts future sales based on ad budget allocation.

# Helps businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
# Python 3

# Pandas, NumPy for data processing

# Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

# scikit-learn for machine learning
